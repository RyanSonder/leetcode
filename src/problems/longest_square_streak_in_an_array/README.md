# Problem: longest_square_streak_in_an_array

## Question:

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subsequence of `nums` is called a square streak if:

* The length of the subsequence is at least 2, and 

* **after** sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the **square** of the previous number.


Return _the length of the **longest square streak** in _`nums`_, or return _`-1`_ if there is no **square streak.**_

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
