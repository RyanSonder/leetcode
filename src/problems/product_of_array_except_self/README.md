# Problem: product_of_array_except_self

## Question:

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.


## Solution:

### Time Complexity:

$O()$


### Runtime:

x ms : Beats y%


### Memory:

x MB : Beats y%


### Thought Process:
